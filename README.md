# Tower Defense
The idea behind a tower defense game is a simple one. Using stationary towers that the player can buy or upgrade, the player must try to destroy all enemies before they reach the end of the level. Most tower defense games have a win and lose condition. In my game, I only implemented a lose condition. After each level if the player hasn't lost, the level increases, the player gets more upgrade points, and more enemies are spawned with higher health.

## Features
* Players have stats including: Health, ExpPoints, and CurrentLevel.
* Players can place or upgrade towers using ExpPoints.
* Every level progressively gets harder by adding more enemies and giving them each more health.
* Every 8th level players are given a boss to destroy.
* Enemies have an algorithm for path finding.
* Enemies and projectiles share a collision algorithm that reduces health and stops rendering both elements on the canvas.

## Technologies
* HTML5 Canvas
* CSS
* Javascript

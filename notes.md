Personal pitch needs to be the answer to "Tell me about yourself" and "Why do you want to work at this company"



------------------- PERSONAL PITCH -------------------

* I decided to be a software developer because I love to build things

* I have built websites using Ruby on Rails with a postgresql backend with a React/Redux front end, and I've also come to really enjoy the visual design portion of building a website. 

* Originally I am from Hawaii and I made the move to NYC to pursue a career in acting. Ultimately I kind of got stuck working service jobs for multiple years and I decided that I needed to find something that I actually enjoyed doing, I could not spend the rest of my life waiting tables. I am an avid gamer and I grew up going to a tech charter high school so I have always had an interest in computer technologies. Also with my acting background, collaboration is really huge for me so finding something that allowed me to work with both a creative and technical team was very important. So I made the switch to become a developer and over the last 6 months I have been honing my skills with both the front end and backend of building an application. 

* A few projects I'm proud of building, the first is a website I cloned. The original website was called Untapped and it's kind of like yelp for beer, except I made my clone focus on wine. I spent a lot of time with CSS trying to get my website to look exactly like untapped except for some color differences.

1. Becuase your company is still growing I am really looking forward to working with smaller teams, getting to know my coworkers and working with a very collaboritive focus are things I am passionate about. 

2. I also love that your company has a focus on algorithm analysis and computer science fundamentals, both are topics that I find very interesting and I often spend my free-time on coding sites trying to figure out new algorithmic problems and practicing algorithms I already feel comfortable with.

3. I come from a Ruby on Rails and Javascript background so I am very glad that your company focuses on these technologies and I would love the opportunity to learn more about Ruby/ Javascript and grow with your company.
